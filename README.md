Tools Used
MongoDB
https://www.mongodb.com
MongoDB is a good choice for use with frontend programs.  Instead of having to define columns and rows, each record is stored as a document containing all of its own properties and values.  This lends itself well to creating interactive dashboards for displaying data.
Python
https://www.python.org
Python was chosen for this project due to its ease of use and the wide availability of support and add on features and libraries.
PyMongo
https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
PyMongo is the recommend driver for using Python to interact with MongoDb.
Dash Framework
https://plotly.com/dash/
Dash is a Python framework that works well for creating web-based dashboards to display data.
Steps Taken
1.	Import animal shelter data into a MongoDB database.
2.	Create/use a CRUD module to connect to the database using Python.
3.	Build a frontend dashboard using Dash to display documents from the database.
Challenges Encountered
During the course of this procedure, I was confronted with a great deal of difficulty, which was far more than I ought to have faced while constructing this straightforward dashboard.  Due in part to a lack of knowledge with the process of constructing a frontend using Python or Dash, this is the case.  Utilizing versions of all of these tools that are not up to date is another aspect, and as a result, it is necessary to make use of Apporto in order to guarantee that all of the appropriate versions were used.  Considering that Apporto may be a nuisance and slow down the development process, I make it a point to avoid using it whenever it is practicable to do so.  The use of Jupyter Notebook was by far the most difficult obstacle to overcome.  Despite the fact that it was a dreadful experience that made the project unreasonably more difficult, it is not apparent why it was required for this class or why it was selected for instruction.  I overcame these obstacles by persevering through them and experimenting with other approaches until I found one that worked the way I wanted it to.
